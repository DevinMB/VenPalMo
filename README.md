# VenPalMo
My first attempt at a consumer payment platform system.

VenPalMo is a digital payment platform that combines the convenience and security of PayPal and Venmo with the added ability to send messages between users. With VenPalMo, you can easily and securely send and receive money from friends and family, and also keep track of your transactions through direct communication with your contacts. VenPalMo makes it easy to manage your finances on the go. Whether you're paying for a group dinner, splitting rent, or sending a gift, VenPalMo has you covered.

The application is built using Docker and Docker Compose, making it easy to run on any system with Docker installed.

To start the VenPalMo application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Start the application using docker-compose.
4. This will start the application and all of its services. Once the services are up and running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.
5. To stop the application, use the CTRL+C keyboard shortcut in your terminal.
